## Visualizing With Pymol

- In the previous slide we plotted our MSA alignment, the pLDDT scores, and the predicted alignement error. However, it is also useful to visualize the actual predicted protein structure and compare it to the known structure if there is one. Here we use a software called PyMOL to do just that:

- Here we see that PyMOL takes either the PDB ID or a PDB file and creates a vizualization for us to examine. If you have not done so already please [download PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) and open the app. You should see a window like the follwing:

![](images/pymolSession.png)

- Here we have a:
  - **History Window** with log of previous commands
  - **Command Interface** to enter PyMOL commands
  - **List of Objects Loaded** which list of objects/proteins that have been loaded into PyMOL
  - **Visualization Window** to visualize protiens loaded into PyMOL

- Let's try on our data!

## AlphaFold Output In PyMOL

- First we will need to download our predicted structure pdb files. To this go to Files > Home Directory:

- Then navigate to your AlphaFold Workshop directory
